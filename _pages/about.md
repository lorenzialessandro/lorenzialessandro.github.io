Hi, I'm Alessandro! 👋🏻😀

I am currently pursuing a Master's in **Artificial Intelligence Systems** at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/) (🇮🇹), where I'm building advanced skills in AI-driven solutions, machine learning, and optimization.

Previously, I worked as an IT consultant specializing in digital transformation, where I led projects to modernize processes and developed custom management solutions tailored to client needs.

My background includes a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** at the University of Trento, providing a strong foundation in software development, data structures, and algorithms.

Discover more about my recent projects on the dedicated **[projects page](projects)** !

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
