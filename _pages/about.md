# 👋🏻 Hello!

Welcome to my personal space on the web! I'm a passionate AI enthusiast currently pursuing my Master's in **Artificial Intelligence Systems** at the University of Trento. My background is in **Computer Science**, and I'm deeply interested in:

- 🚀 Computer Vision & Deep Learning
- 🤖 Reinforcement Learning & Intelligent Agents
- 📈 Optimization & Data Science
- 💡 Exploring new technologies & AI-driven solutions

I love building things! Check out some of my projects on the dedicate **[repositories](repositories)** page or directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/lorenzialessandro).

Feel free to reach out — I'm always happy to discuss AI, tech, or new ideas! 📫

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
